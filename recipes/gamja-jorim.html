        <h1>Gamja Jorim</h1>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A deliciously sweet but savoury potato dish, usually accompanying a main dish in Korean cooking.</p>
        <p>Simple and satisfying.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound of baby potatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable or any cooking oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons rice syrup (or honey, or sugar)</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Trim any rotten spots or broken edges from the potatoes. Wash and rinse in cold water to remove any
                dirt. Strain.</li>
            <li>Add the cooking oil to a 10 to 12 inch thick skillet, over medium heat. Add the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook for 20 minutes until fully cooked. Shake and move the skillet every 5 minutes so that the
                potatoes cook evenly and don't burn.</li>
            <li>Turn down the heat to low and add the soy sauce, rice syrup, and garlic. Stir it all together with a
                wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Turn up the heat to medium. Keep stirring and cooking for another 4 to 5 minutes until the sauce is
                reduced and the potatoes look shiny and wrinkly.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and mix with the sesame oil. Sprinkle the sesame seeds over top.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a serving bowl and serve with rice. Refrigerate any leftovers for up to 4 days.</li>
        </ol>
